I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. There are no limits in this world. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. I like to beat the brush.

Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.

Now then, let's play. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Everybody needs a friend.

Here's something that's fun. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here.

I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. The light is your friend. Preserve it.

I thought today we would do a happy little picture. You're meant to have fun in life. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you.

A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose.
