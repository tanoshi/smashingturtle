Privacy policy  
We, the companies of the Ströer Group, take the protection of your personal data very seriously and we want you to feel comfortable visiting our websites. The protection of your personal data is an important concern for us. We process your personal data, which has been collected upon your visit to our website, according to the applicable data protection laws.
  

I. Collection and Processing of Personal Data  
Personal data is only saved if you have provided such information to us because, e.g. of a registration, survey, prize contest or the execution of a contract. If you have furnished us with personal data and information, we will only use this data and information to answer your questions, process your contract and for technical administration. Your personal data and information will only be disclosed to third parties if this is required for contractual performance, invoicing, or you have otherwise given your prior consent. You have the right at any time to revoke your consent effective from the date consent is revoked. Personal data shall be deleted if you revoke your consent to collect or record such information, if this information is no longer needed to be retained in order to fulfill the intended purpose behind collecting and recording such data, or if such record is otherwise no longer permissible according to law. Upon a written request therefor, we would be happy to provide you with information about the personal data that we have recorded about you.  


II. Web Tracking  
Some of the data recorded upon a visit to our website is used for statistical purposes. This information is only forwarded to our statistics service provider,  Webtrekk GmbH. The companies of the Ströer Group use the services of Webtrekk GmbH in order to collect statistical data about how our website is used so that we may correspondingly optimize our offers. Within the context of web tracking, cookies are placed as described below and your IP address is saved only temporarily for the duration of your visit as described below. Your IP address is immediately deleted after you leave our website so that the information collected via web tracking is anonymous and the identity of the user can no longer be determined. You may object to the use and storage of such data made anonymous (s.V.).  

III. IP Address  
When you visit our website our web server automatically records the IP address assigned to you by your Internet service provider, the website from which you have accessed our website, the websites that you visit on our platform, the date and the duration of your visit. Neither our statistics service provider nor we permanently record the IP address, but rather only use it for session recognition and for defending attacks. The IP address is then immediately deleted so that the information collected remains anonymous and the user’s identity can no longer be determined.  
  
IV. Cookies  
Our Internet pages use so-called cookies in several places. They are designed to make our offers more user-friendly and effective. Cookies are small text files, which are placed on your computer and saved by your browser. Cookies can be used to determine whether a communication link has already been established to our pages from your computer. Cookies cannot be allocated to particular persons and do not contain personal information. This information is not consolidated with other data sources. Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies” that are deleted when your browser session ends. There are, however, durable cookies, which we use to re-identify you as a visitor. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain viruses. You can adjust your browser settings to accept or block cookies. If you specifically would not like to be tracked for this website, you may object thereto according to the provisions contained in V. below.   


V. Revocation of Consent to Save Data  
Pursuant to §15 of the German Telemedia Act visitors to websites may object to the use of data collected about themselves that has been made anonymous so that information is no longer collected about them in the future. In order to exclude any information from being collected further from Webtrekk Web-Controlling a cookie named webTrekkOptOut is placed on the user’s computer from the domain www.stroeer.com. This objection or revocation is only valid so long as you do not delete this cookie. If you would like to submit an objection to saving visitor information about you that has been made anonymous, please send an e-mail to feedback@stroeer.de  entitled “Objection to Saving Data”.
