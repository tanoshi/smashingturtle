That's crazy. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. This is your world.

There comes a nice little fluffer. Just use the old one inch brush. You are only limited by your imagination. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you.

A happy cloud. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Put it in, leave it alone. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.

Let's put a touch more of the magic here. You need the dark in order to show the light. I like to beat the brush. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. In your world you have total and absolute power.

The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.

Don't fight it, use what happens. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.

A beautiful little sunset. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.
