Use what you see, don't plan it. This is the fun part Everybody needs a friend. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.


You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. There comes a nice little fluffer. Every day I learn. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. This is truly an almighty mountain. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens.


That's crazy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.

We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. We'll do another happy little painting. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.

Let's build some happy little clouds up here. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.

Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. This piece of canvas is your world. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Isn't that fantastic? Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.

You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Let your imagination be your guide. Work that paint. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces.
